## AFC-MADE resources
- `ISO_LRPF`: Our resource group that everything (resources) sits under
- `geointerns`: Storage account (like AWS s3 bucket) for this project's data and ML workspace's autogenerated metadata. Containers and fileshares are all under here. 
    - `xview` is a blob container with the training and validation data from XVIEW 1
- `geointerns_workspace`: Machine learning workspace, studio environment with compute, autoconnects to previously created files (like AWS sagemaker/coeus)
